A Discord bot for the virtual pet adoption website [Chicken Smoothie](https://www.chickensmoothie.com). With this bot you can view information on pets and pound opening times straight from Discord without accessing the website.

Due to the discontinuation of Discord.py (Read more about it [here](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1)), this repository is another complete rewrite of CS-Pound code after the first when migrating from Discord.py "async" to "rewrite" branch. In continuation on the maintenance of this bot, it is being rewritten again to use another Python Discord library called [Hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari) and [Tanjun](https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Tanjun). This rewrite will allow the use of Slash commands on Discord, allowing for easier management of commands on servers without conflicting prefixes.
