A Discord bot for the virtual pet adoption website [Chicken Smoothie](https://www.chickensmoothie.com). With this bot you can view information on pets and pound opening times straight from Discord without accessing the website.

Due to recent changes to the future of Discord.py (Read more about it [here](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1)), this repository is another complete rewrite of CS-Pound code after the first one when migrating from Discord.py "async" to "rewrite". In continuation of my maintenance efforts on this bot is being migrated to use another Python Discord library called [Hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari) and [Tanjun](https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Tanjun). This migration will also make use of the new Slash commands on Discord with the current prefix method of using commands being deprecated.
